This tutorial runs on the main dPay blockchain.

## Intro

This tutorial will show the method of capturing a queried tag name and matching it to the dPay database. We are using the `call` function provided by the `ddpays` library to pull tags from the dPay blockchain. A simple HTML interface is used to both capture the string query as well as display the completed search.

## steps

1.  [**Configure connection**](#configure-conn) Configuration of `ddpays` to use the proper connection and network.
2.  [**Search input**](#search-input) Collecting the relevant search criteria
3.  [**Run Search**](#run-search) Running the search on the blockchain
4.  [**Output**](#output) Displaying the results of the search query

#### 1. Configure connection <a name="configure-conn"></a>

Below we have `ddpays` pointing to the production network with the proper chainId, addressPrefix, and endpoint. There is a `public/app.js` file which holds the Javascript segment of this tutorial. In the first few lines we define the configured library and packages:

```javascript
const ddpays = require('ddpays');
let opts = {};
//connect to production server
opts.addressPrefix = 'STM';
opts.chainId =
    '38f14b346eb697ba04ae0f5adcfaa0a437ed3711197704aa256a14cb9b4a8f26';
//connect to server which is connected to the network/production
const client = new ddpays.Client('https://api.dpays.io');
```

#### 2. Search input <a name="search-input"></a>

Collecting of the search criteria happens via an HTML input. The form can be found in the `index.html` file. The values are pulled from that screen with the below:

```javascript
const max = 10;
window.submitTag = async () => {
    const tagSearch = document.getElementById("tagName").value;
```

#### 3. Run Search <a name="run-search"></a>

In order to access the blockchain to run the search a `call` function is used with the `search field` and `maximum` list items as parameters.

```javascript
const _tags = await client.database.call('get_trending_tags',[tagSearch, max]);
```

The result of the search is an array of tags along with their respective vital data like `comments`, `payouts`, etc.

#### 4. Output <a name="output"></a>

Due to the output from the `call` function being an array, we can't use a simple `post` function to display the tags. The specific fields within the array needs to be selected and then displayed.

```javascript
console.log('tags: ', _tags);
var posts = [];
_tags.forEach(post => {
    posts.push(
        `<div class="list-group-item"><h5 class="list-group-item-heading">${
            post.name
        }</h5></div>`
    );
});
//disply list of tags with line breaks
document.getElementById('tagList').innerHTML = posts.join('<br>');
```

### To run this tutorial

1.  clone this repo
1.  `cd tutorials/16_search_tags`
1.  `npm i`
1.  `npm run dev-server` or `npm run start`
1.  After a few moments, the server should be running at http://localhost:3000/
